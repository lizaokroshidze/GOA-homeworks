    <p><h3>The Mona Lisa</h3>painted by <h5>Leonardo da Vinci </h5>between 1503 and 1506, is one of the most famous works in Western art. Originally commissioned by Francesco del Giocondo, a wealthy Florentine merchant, as a portrait of his wife, Lisa Gherardini, the painting was never delivered and stayed with da Vinci. Its fame grew due to its mysterious smile, realistic details, and da Vincis use of sfumato, a technique for soft transitions between colors and tones.<br>

        The painting is currently housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, where it has been displayed since 1797. It became a cultural icon in the 20th century, partly due to its theft in 1911, which spurred global interest. Today, the Mona Lisa remains a symbol of enigmatic beauty and Renaissance art.</p>
